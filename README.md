Very ugly Haskell port of Cactus Kev&#39;s (http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html) 5 card poker hand evaluator

Note: This is the first Haskell program I ever wrote (and by wrote, I mean smashed a c style program from another auther into a language I know little about)...it is very slow and would probably make experienced Haskeller's eyes bleed. It works though :)
